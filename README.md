# AI Image Detection Project (AI vs Real)

This project classifies images as **AI-generated** or **Real** using a deep learning model based on the **MobileNet architecture**.  
The model is trained using transfer learning and achieves **very high accuracy** on validation and test data.


##  Features
- Binary image classification: **AI-generated vs Real**
- Transfer Learning using **MobileNet**
- High accuracy and strong generalization
- Clean GitHub repository (dataset & virtual environment excluded)
- Ready for inference and deployment
